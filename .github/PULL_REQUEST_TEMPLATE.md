### GPU / CUDA / ONNX Note
If your PR touches GPU code (CUDA, ONNX runtime, device providers, .cu files, or environment flags like `BEATSYNC_ONNX_USE_CUDA`):
- Add the label **`test-cuda`** to the PR so the gated CUDA integration workflow runs on a GPU-enabled runner.
- Optionally mention which GPU/drivers were used for testing and any special setup.

Thanks!
